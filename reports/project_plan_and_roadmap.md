# Research Project Plan & Roadmap

**Title:** Prediction and Local Explainable AI (XAI) in Healthcare  
**Duration:** October 2025 – January 2026  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. Beate Rhein  
**Industry Partner:** Nightingale Heart — Mr. Håkan Lane

---

## Project Overview

The project targets predictive modeling of heart-related risks using ~40,000 survey responses from a European health and lifestyle study. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and a PyTorch-based neural network establish the modelling baseline; the best-performing tuned model will ultimately power the user-facing experience. Local explainability will be delivered through LIME and SHAP, with results surfaced via a Gradio web interface. Docker will containerize the full workflow for reproducibility and deployment.

### Dataset Highlights

- Structured CSV with demographic, lifestyle, and wellness variables.
- **Primary target:** `hltprhc` (heart condition: 1 = yes, 0 = no)
- **Secondary targets:** `hltprhb` (blood pressure), `hltprdi` (diabetes)

## Research Objectives

1. Build and compare baseline predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, PyTorch NN).
2. Perform early error analysis (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrices, misclassified samples).
3. Tune models and validate performance on unseen data.
4. Apply LIME and SHAP for individual-level explanations.
5. Conduct literature review informed by error analysis and model behaviour.
6. Draft Methods, Results, and Discussion sections in parallel with experiments.
7. Develop a Gradio demo for interactive, interpretable predictions.
8. Containerize the full pipeline using Docker.

## 3-Month Roadmap (Biweekly Sprints, ~20 hrs/week)

### Weeks 1–2 (Oct 20 – Nov 2): Data Understanding, Baseline Modeling & Error Analysis

- Load and explore dataset (~40k records); perform EDA (distributions, missing values, correlations, target balance). Convert height/weight to BMI and drop the `cntry` categorical feature so the processed dataset is fully numeric before persisting `data/processed/health_clean.csv`.
- Preprocess: normalization, encoding, imputation, BMI derivation.
- Train baseline models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM) plus a simple PyTorch NN.
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC; generate confusion matrices and misclassification plots.
- Initialize GitHub repository, requirements.txt, Dockerfile; draft Introduction & Methods sections.
- **Deliverables:** Clean dataset, baseline metrics, error plots, initial Docker setup.
